# store your otp_secret in the MacOS keychain with the following command:

#     ACCOUNT_NAME="otp_secret"
#     security add-generic-password -l "$SERVICE_NAME ($ACCOUNT_NAME)" -s "$SERVICE_NAME" -a "$ACCOUNT_NAME" -T "" -w
# it will prompt you for typing the otp_secret (twice)

# Note: with this entry the keychain will access for your keychain password on every access of the item. However if you press
# the "Always allow" button then it won't anymore in the future. It adds 'security' as app which it always allows
# access to the entry. In the "keychain access" app you could remove this exception for the 'security' app.
# note: you cannot unset it with the security cmdline tool. However you could delete the entry and recreate it with above command.

# lookup labels to find entry in keychain
SERVICE_NAME="xbar_easy_ssh_tunnels"
ACCOUNT_NAME="otp_secret" # we abused account name to get specific secret for the xbar easy ssh tunnel plugin

# Get the otp_secret from the Keychain
otp_secret=$(security find-generic-password -s "${SERVICE_NAME}" -a "${ACCOUNT_NAME}" -w 2>/dev/null)
# generate otp code and output it to stdout
